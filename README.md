The application is written in dart/flutter. It designed for android devices and called YesArt. It allows to study and memorise 625 world famouse paintings of 110 artists and 25 styles in English or Russian. It respects the copyright, so only paitings copyright free are exposed.
The button with an image of a student hat allows to study. It openes a list of artists in the alphabetic order with mini images of their paitings and paiting's names. Each paiting from the list can be opened in a large formate as a card, which shows the paiting, its name, its artist's name and its style. By taping on the name of the artist a Wikipedia page is opened showing the artist's biography. By taping on the name of the paiting a page of Wikiart is opened, showing the paiting's details: dimensions, year, original name and etc. By taping on the image it is opened in a full screen. By taping on it again, it returns back to the original size. It is possible to study the list in a formate of cards or in a format of the list.  It is possible to sort the list by artist or by style. The digit in the down-rigth corner shows a number of paitings in the sorted list.
Three buttons with images of a curve, a brush and a pallette are quizzes: the curve is a test of style knowledge, the brush - a test of artist knowledge, the pallete - a test of painting knowledge.
